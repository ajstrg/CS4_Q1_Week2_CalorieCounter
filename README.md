# CS4_Q1_Week2_CalorieCounter

Task

Imagine that you’re trying to make a tool that will help you keep track of the calories that you burn through regular exercise.
For each day, you can choose whether to walk (300 kcal), swim (550 kcal), or cycle (700 kcal).
You can also choose how many hours you will do it for the particular day.

After 7 days, the application should show the total calories burned for the week and will ask if it will repeat the process.
